List of problems that we address within the `COeXISTENCE` project with the relavant literature on them.

The base is the reference list used in the proposal:  [here](files/full_references_from_proposal.pdf).

Each section starts with a narrative part, which is expanded gradually and with a list of papers (with comments).

## Research problems

### Route choice

> We assume humans are Rational Utility Maximizers (Manski, 1977), thus when they travel they maximize their utility (McFadden, 1980), i.e. in the route choice context, they make subjectively rational choices (Ben-Akiva et al, 1984), or boundedly rational
