Trips with their origins, destinations, and travel times are now collected in publicly available databases, allowing for detailed demand forecasting with methods exploiting big and accurate data. In this paper, we predict the demand pattern of New York City bikes with a low-dimensional approach utilizing three-level data clustering. We use historical demand data along with temperature and precipitation to first aggregate and then decompose data to obtain meaningful clusters. The core of this approach lies in the proposed clustering technique, which reduces the dimension of the problem and, differently from other machine learning techniques, requires limited assumptions on the model or its parameters. The proposed method allows, for the given temperature and precipitation method, to obtain expected vector of movement (mean number and direction of trips) for each zone. In this paper, we synthesize more than 17 million trips into daily and zonal vectors of movement, which combined with weather data allow forecasting of the trip demand. The method allows us to predict the demand with over 75\% accuracy, as shown in series of experiments in which various settings and parameterizations are validated against 25\% holdout data. },

abstract = {This paper studies a trajectory-based traffic management (TTM) problem for the purpose of managing traffic in a road facility reserved exclusively for autonomous vehicles (AV). The base TTM model aims to find optimal trajectories for multiple AVs while resolving inter-vehicle conflicts in the most generic way. The model is formulated as a mixed integer program (MIP) that can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. To improve computational efficiency, a specialized algorithm based on the rolling horizon approach is also developed. We then show that the base TTM model can be easily extended to first accommodate scheduling decisions (the TTMS model) and to further impose equity constraints (the TTMSE model). For the simplest network and homogeneous users, solutions to TTMS and TTMSE are similar, respectively, to system optimal (SO) and user equilibrium (UE) solutions of Vickreyâ€™s bottleneck model. Numerical experiments highlight TTMâ€™s ability to simultaneously generate optimal trajectories for multiple vehicles. They also show that, while solving TTM exactly is computationally demanding, obtaining good approximate solutions can be accomplished efficiently by the rolling horizon algorithm.}

address = {New York, NY, USA},
abstract = {In many markets, new technologies allow traditional jobs to be divided into discrete tasks that are widely distributed across workers and dynamically priced given prevailing supply and demand conditions. This "sharing" or "gig" economy represents a more flexible work system, and is most common in two-sided markets in which a firm acts as a platform to connect service providers and consumers. One prominent example of this is the ride-sharing company Uber, which connects riders and driver-partners, and dynamically prices trips using a system known as "surge" pricing. In this talk, I discuss the practical problems of designing such a dynamic pricing system, how that dynamic pricing coordinates workers who can now earn compensation on a flexible schedule, and more broadly how the "gig" economy is evolving and growing as a form of market organization.},
